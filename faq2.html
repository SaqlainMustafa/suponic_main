                                        considering wagering as a part of gambling. In the United States, except for six states, wagering is considered legal in 40 states. Nevada has declared all sports wagering as 100% legal by the state law. Even in
                                        Canada, where the restriction is well known to be very strict, it states that it is the freedom of the individual citizens to enter the wagering platform of companies operated outside Canada. Therefore, it is considered
                                        legal for other people to play wagering and enjoy eSports on the platform operated by Suponic, which has a corporation in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA..</p>
